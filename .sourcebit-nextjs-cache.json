In 2022 alone, we have seen a number of high profile streamers discuss how they have burnout. But what is streamer burnout and how can we recognise it? \n\nStarting out as a streamer is full of possibility and excitement. You’re energised thinking about the content you’re going to create. You go live and then everything changes. Maybe you explode and the pressures of maintaining that popularity pile on. Perhaps the feedback comes flooding in and you feel you have to make changes. Maybe no one comes to your stream or watches your videos. Either way, over time, the pressures placed on you to adapt can strip away the enjoyment. As time goes by, you feel your energy drain. It’s like your thoughts are getting slower and you feel emotionally fragile. Are these feelings caused by what you have eaten for breakfast or the previous night’s poor sleep? Maybe, but if these feelings last in time, then I am sorry to say they could be symptoms of burnout. \n\nBurnout is defined as a state of physical and emotional exhaustion. Burnout typically occurs when experiencing long-term stress in your job, or when you have worked in a physically or emotionally draining role for a long time. Whilst many of you may not recognise these factors when streaming, others will. It takes an emotional toll to present yourself to others for hours on end. In psychological terms this is called emotional labour. More on this later. \n\n### Why streamer burnout happens?\n\n“Burnout is an incredibly real thing in streaming,” says Imane Anys, AKA [Pokimane](https://www.twitch.tv/pokimane?lang=it), who became the most popular female streamer on Twitch, with 9.2 million subscribers. She described on her secondary channel how she had to take a pause from [Twitch to deal with burnout.](https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/pokimane-to-step-back-from-the-rat-race-of-twitch-streaming-3303210) “I recognize I’m very lucky to be able to work, however, I need to do what’s best for my mental health,” Pokimane explained. “A streamer sets their own work hours and it can be easy to fall into the trap of streaming eight to 12 hours a day, seven days a week. It’s frightening because people grind crazy long hours and see results – hence why so many do it.”\n\n![](/images/Pokimane-2022.jpeg)\n\nYou may see the signs of burnout in yourself or the streamers you watch. [Signs](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2018/02/ce-corner#:~:text=According%20to%20psychologist%20Christina%20Maslach,lack%20of%20accomplishment%20\\(%20Maslach%20Burnout) such as Physical and emotional exhaustion, Cynicism about the work, Detachment or alienation from work-related activities, Headaches or stomach aches, Reduced creativity, Depression, and Difficulty sleeping, eating or generally caring for yourself are common. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, burnout and emotional labour are often positively correlated. [Ashforth and Humphrey](https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMR.1993.3997508) defined emotional labour as “the act of displaying appropriate emotions, with the goal to engage in a form of impression management”. For streamers, this is the act of creating an impression in the minds of their audience. Perhaps streamers wish to appear competent at a game, attractive and desirable, humorous or any number of the positive ways we seek to present ourselves to others. Presenting an impression for long periods of time, however, can be exhausting. Think about the last time you took a flight. Consider the behaviour of the flight attendant or pilot who supported you. Within such roles, staff are expected to smile, be attentive, and calm. It’s understandable. No one wants to be sat in a tin can that’s about to fly at thousands of feet and hear the pilot crying over the intercom system. Your life is in that person’s hands and they have to present an impression of calm competence. Suppressing your emotion to present an expected impression takes an emotional toll. Just like the actors playing perfect Disney Princesses for eight hours a day seven days a week at Disney World, many streamers will feel they need to present a version of self. Even if it’s not drastically different from the version of you without a camera in your face, there is still a knowledge that what you say and do will be in the public domain. It is natural to want to want to create a positive impression, but it’s important to realise that this type of interaction can take an emotional toll. \n\n### TIPS TO AVOID BURNOUT\n\nIn a statement to provide support for streamer’s mental health, Twitch said that they are “developing targeted programming to support content creators with challenges like burnout, boundary-setting, and other pressures that come with a career in online content creation.\"\\* \\*Whilst they figure this out, here are some tips that we suggest to avoid streamer burnout:\n\nStreaming should be part of the routine, but not your life: As ZeaIand, a streamer on Twitch with almost 100,000 followers, said on our [previous interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEf-dFFrYFw)\\* \\*“the nature of content creation is that every single person that does it, has to find their own way to deal with it, and find a workload they are comfortable with. The best you can do is **educate people on what they can do to take care of themselves.**” \n\nPokimane explained how she dealt with her burnout, caused by, what she feels, are the “insane amount of hours” she streams. By [spending time with her family and friends](https://youtu.be/KRK3s-X-QzM?t=213). “I’ve veered away from doing extreme hours of live streaming in an effort to upkeep my mental health and I’ve found that it aids in the longevity of my career”, she stated after her decision to take a pause from work. You need to **connect with your ‘offline’ life** and take a break from constantly worrying about work. Creating a plan for your whole day could help keeping track of the hours that you dedicate to streaming. \n\nJob crafting: by improving and making more interesting your own work you can have a better performance. Job crafting is a creative process regarding the strategies that are done by the workers to adapt to the request from the job. An example could be to **develop a new skill** by changing the type of game that you typically play or streaming about something else entirely. \n\nDo physical activity, eat well and have a regular sleep pattern: when you lack sleep and proper nutrition, when you are constantly in a sitting position for many hours, it is going to be difficult to have the energy to do the things you wanted to do. Physical activity helps you **release endorphins** (produce a feeling of euphoria), eating well and getting enough sleep will **give you the energy** to sustain your working hour. The latter may be especially difficult to maintain for the streamers since some tend to stream during night-time. These aspects will help you to be more focus the next day and be more creative.**A positive mindset brings positive things**: Another thing that could lead to burnout are *trolls*. Many streamers experience burnout because they tend to focus only on the negative comments that came over continuously, and it’s mentally draining. As stated by Daniel Howell, “it’s only natural to take that one in a thousand comment and **scale it up** to everyone hates me”. In this case the best thing to do is to **detach** yourself from what is going on and remind yourself that those comments are not related to your person, they shouldn’t weigh on your life. **Remember that it’s your channel**, your content, and that you have the power to stop at any time.\n\nIf you're concerned about burnout or [need a mate](/programmes) to talk to, we're here to help.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/can-gaming-make-you-smarter.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/can-gaming-make-you-smarter.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/can-gaming-make-you-smarter.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/can-gaming-make-you-smarter"},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"excerpt":"Recent research has shown that gaming can have a positive effect on wellbeing.

It is estimated that 1 in 6 people would have experienced a common mental health problem in the past week (mentalhealth.org). Mental health issues are also one of the main causes of the overall disease burden worldwide, meaning it’s one of the biggest impactors of health and wellbeing on the global population.\n\nRecent research has shown that gaming can have a positive effect on wellbeing. A study conducted at the University of Oxford found playing video games is positively correlated with overall wellbeing. (<https://psyarxiv.com/qrjza>). Policy makers around the world have been contemplating the regulation of video game playing time and its overall influence on wellbeing, even though there isn’t enough adequate data to justify these notions, and the findings revealed so far support the idea that gaming may actually facilitate positive mental health.\n\nSo here’s a few benefits that video gaming can have on your mental health:\n\nVideo games lead to healthy brain stimulation- Most games promote the stimulation and use of many different areas in the brain, such as problem solving, decision-making, pattern recognition, and many more. It also provokes multiple dimensions of critical thinking and improves analytical skills. In part 3 of the series, we’ll be going into much more detail regarding these aspects.\n\nPlaying games can help relieve stress- Immersing yourself into an RPG, working through an action-adventure franchise, or battling against others online are excellent ways to relinquish stress. Gaming is an interactive and diverse tool for unwinding, and promotes ‘positive escapism’- taking a break from reality in order to decompress from a rough day or week, and providing an opportunity to gain some perspective on the daily stresses of life.\n\nVideo games can help you develop coping strategies- When faced with a difficult life situation, people tend to use coping mechanisms in order to deal with the obstacles they’re facing. While some of these mechanisms can be negative, such as abusing drugs and alcohol, gaming incites opportunities to learn how to effectively cope with real-life difficulties by overcoming virtual adversities, invoking perseverance and promoting a sense of achievement.\n\nIntertwining with mental health is ‘social connection’, which is defined as: “The relationships you have with the people around you”. They may be close by such as family, friends and co-workers, or far away, meaning you only connect with them over the phone or online.\n\nHaving social connections with others in any form are important for a variety of reasons. One of the main outcomes is the development of ‘Resilience’ which is the ability to bounce back after stressful situations, this is strengthened when you give and receive social support. Support from your social connections can also contribute to feelings of purpose and meaning in life. Being there for others, and having people you can turn to when in need are pivotal for improving and maintaining wellbeing.\n\nIn light of recent years, social connection has become more important than ever before. Video games are arguably the best platform for socialising and maintaining relationships. Communication is a constant when gaming online, and creates an almost perfect environment for different capacities of conversations to be shared among friends or new people.\n\nGaming and livestreaming are effective ways to combat loneliness. Loneliness is the perceived feeling of being alone or isolated, regardless of what social connections you have. This modern way of socialising with people who share similar interests and affinities can help overcome the feeling of being alone, while becoming part of a genuinely supportive community.\n\nThere are many different ways to create social connections through gaming, this could be something like joining an esports team or league, playing MMORPGS and other games that involve teamwork and large-scale interaction, or playing online games in general where matchmaking connects you to thousands of people across the World. The possibilities of meeting new people, and staying connected with old friends are endless, and video games make it effortless and enjoyable.\n\nIn summary, playing games in moderation can be an effective way to improve and maintain positive mental wellbeing. The empirical research being conducted supports the idea that video games are actually a useful tool for mental health, going against the baseless statements of policy makers and government officials. Forming and maintaining social connection with others has never been easier through gaming, meeting like minded people at the touch of a key or button promotes the generation of new relationships through fun and enjoyable experiences that bring people together from across the World.\n","styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"narrow","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-1","pb-24","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"left"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"left"},"text":{"textAlign":"left"}},"title":"Can Gaming Make You Smarter?"},{"type":"FeaturedPostsSection","elementId":"","showDate":false,"showAuthor":false,"showExcerpt":false,"variant":"variant-b","actions":[],"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-12","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}},"subtitle":"FEATURED ARTICLES","colors":"colors-a","posts":["content/pages/blog/does-playing-violent-video-games-cause-aggression.md","content/pages/blog/suicidal-thoughts.md"]},{"type":"ContactSection","elementId":"","colors":"colors-c","backgroundSize":"full","title":"INSPIRING IDEAS AND MEANINGFUL ACTION","text":"Join our monthly newsletter to get early access to our content, courses, and more.\n","form":{"variant":"variant-b","fields":[{"name":"email","placeholder":"Your email","isRequired":"true","width":"full","type":"EmailFormControl"}],"submitLabel":"STAY IN THE LOOP","elementId":"newsletter","action":"/.netlify/functions/submission_created","destination":"team@playaid.net","type":"FormBlock"},"media":null,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"narrow","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-24","pb-20","pl-4","pr-4"],"alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center","flexDirection":"row"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"text":{"textAlign":"center"}}}],"title":"Can Gaming Make You Smarter?","date":"2022-11-02","markdown_content":null},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/dark-side-gaming.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/dark-side-gaming.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/dark-side-gaming.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/dark-side-gaming"},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"title":"The Dark Side of Gaming","date":"2022-06-16","excerpt":"Nunc rutrum felis dui, ut consequat sapien scelerisque vel.

Proposing that video games can lead to laziness, aggressiveness and even violent behaviour. However, due to the unstoppable growth of gaming and its firm implementation into modern society, whether many media outlets like it or not, video games are here to stay. \n\nLike with most things, an unjust negative outlook on a particular topic is usually formed due to misinformation and lack of understanding. The somewhat one-sided viewpoint of video games has left a skewed perspective in the eyes of parents, government and health officials. We have attempted to take a critical look at the evidence with a view of providing a more nuanced and balanced perspective of the pros and cons of gaming. In this three part series, we will present the outcome of this investigation. \n\nBefore we dive into the numerous benefits of picking up a gamepad, or using your keyboard and mouse for more than just work and internet surfing, let’s take a look at the perceived negative aspects of gaming. While some are truthful, there are others that are not backed up by empirical research or data. For example:\n\nThe notion that violent video games cause violent behaviour is completely anecdotal. Academic research shows no correlation of violent games inciting real life violent behaviour, in fact, it’s quite the opposite. Video games of any genre have been shown to reduce stress, facilitate relaxation, and regulate emotions. \n\nAfter decades of this completely farcical narrative being pushed in the mainstream media, one game developer company decided to hit back. Rockstar games, the creators of the Grand Theft Auto series, were scrutinised by no other than Hillary Clinton, due to the violent and profane nature of the game franchise. Clinton suggested that new regulations should be introduced to combat games like this. Rockstar subtly responded when they released GTA 4 in 2008, the fictional setting for the game is ‘Liberty City’, which shares strong similarities with New York city, including their very own Statue of Liberty, referred to as the Statue of Happiness. Upon closer inspection, the face of ‘Lady happiness’ shares a striking resemblance to Hillary Clinton. Although Rockstar Games have never confirmed the reference or intent behind this easter egg, it was revealed that the file name for the statue is “stat_hilberty01.wdr”. So you can decide for yourselves. \n\nAnother misconception is that video games are a waste of time, and provide no progression in regard to personal and societal development. Once again this couldn’t be further from the truth. Professional gamers are paid annual salaries, receive bonuses, sponsorship money and donations from fans. Professional streamers are essentially entertainers, they can vary from elite gameplay, comedy, interactive and supportive content. Their revenue streams are very similar, and tend to lead into other career pathways such as esports coaching, presenting and hosting podcasts. In 2021, a streamer by the name of CriticalRole made 9 million dollars just from his live stream alone. Later in the series, we’ll be looking at the plethora of benefits gaming has to offer when it comes to personal and career development. \n\nHowever, this isn’t going to be a one-sided affair, there are some negative elements of gaming that are supported with evidence. The sedentary nature of video gaming is usually the first aspect mentioned. And Yes. Gaming is for the most part an inactive hobby (with the exception of some VR games). However, finding a balance between adequate physical activity and sedentary recreational time is essential when it comes to any hobby. \n\nAdditionally, using video games as a form of negative escapism can also be detrimental to your health. Gaming can become a reliance, and even addictive. Internet Gaming disorder (or IDG) involves an unhealthy fixation on playing games, subsequently causing other aspects of life to fall by the way-side. Behaviours include a preoccupation with gaming, withdrawal symptoms when gaming is taken away or not possible, and continuing to game despite problems.\n\nLike everything, though, too much of something good can lead to undesirable outcomes. Prioritising video games over essential activities such as sleep, nutrition, and physical activity can be damaging to your physical and mental wellbeing. What seems to be often overlooked is the fact that video games are merely a tool just like anything else. It’s no different to exercising, watching films and TV shows, or even reading books. Doing any activity to excess can be harmful to your health, even the ones with positive connotations. For example, if you exercise excessively, you can cause your physical and mental health to decline over time. If you spent all your time reading, and sacrificed sleep, eating and physical activity as a result, that would also be bad for your wellbeing. \n\nIn summary, video games have been given a bad wrap over the years, but the powers that be are not telling both sides of the story. Nevertheless, this stigmatisation hasn’t managed to stop the gaming scene from becoming one of the biggest conglomerates in the world. As long as a healthy balance is achieved and maintained, video games can provide a plethora of mental, developmental, and social benefits. \n\nIn Part 2, we’ll be taking a look at the ways gaming can facilitate positive mental wellbeing and social connection, hit the subscribe button to be notified, and check out our website for more information on gaming and health. \n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/dezachu.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/dezachu.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/dezachu.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/dezachu"},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"title":"Dezachu on Shout-casting and Mental Health in Rainbow Six and League of Legends","date":"2022-05-22","excerpt":"Many of us dream about a career in Esports and getting paid to do what we love, maybe shout casting could be for for you?

Broadly speaking, the best available evidence does not support the position that playing violent video games is related to aggressive behaviour. The evidence also suggests that the amount of time a teenager spends playing violent video games does not predict whether or not he will engage in aggressive behaviour. However, it is important to note that some mechanics and situations in gaming cause players to feel angry. Some examples include feeling incompetent, trash talking or competing with other players during gameplay. These are still important and under researched topics that have direct implications on antisocial online behaviours such as bullying, trolling and griefing. However, there is limited evidence to suggest these behaviours transcend into off-line settings. \n\nDespite the evidence, it will likely remain an unsettled question for parents, pundits and policy-makers whether violent video games drive aggressive behavior. For us, video games are just the latest medium to come under media scrutiny. History tells us that cinema and even books have been subjected to similar concerns. This is not to say that the immersive nature of video games may not affect people differently, but to provide a wider context that these are not new concerns. Whilst the focus in the media has been on the perceived relationship between playing violent video games and violent behaviour, less focus has been on the positives. The social benefits are now well established and psychological benefits are emerging. However, most of these relationships are mediated by, to some extent, individual differences in the players. We argue that the effect of video games on a person's well-being is dependent on multiple factors, including the type or style of game being played, the motivation behind its use, and moderation in gameplay. \n","styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"narrow","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-6","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"left"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"left"},"text":{"textAlign":"left"}}},{"type":"FeaturedPostsSection","elementId":"","showDate":false,"showAuthor":false,"showExcerpt":false,"variant":"variant-b","actions":[],"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-12","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}},"subtitle":"Featured Articles","colors":"colors-a","posts":["content/pages/blog/does-playing-violent-video-games-cause-aggression.md","content/pages/blog/suicidal-thoughts.md"]},{"type":"ContactSection","elementId":"","colors":"colors-c","backgroundSize":"full","title":"INSPIRING IDEAS AND MEANINGFUL ACTION","text":"Join our monthly newsletter to get early access to our research, advocacy work, courses and more.\n","form":{"variant":"variant-b","fields":[{"name":"email","placeholder":"Your email","isRequired":"true","width":"full","type":"EmailFormControl"}],"submitLabel":"STAY IN THE LOOP","elementId":"newsletter","action":"/.netlify/functions/submission_created","destination":"team@playaid.net","type":"FormBlock"},"media":null,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"narrow","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-24","pb-20","pl-4","pr-4"],"alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center","flexDirection":"row"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"text":{"textAlign":"center"}}}],"markdown_content":"![](/images/GTA-V-Trevor-Philips-Lake-Body.jpg)\n\nMost young people in the developed world play video games. Many play violent video games. Since the inception of gaming as a recreational activity there have been concerns about possible negative effects. Studies polling members of the general public as well as scientists suggest that views concerning the effects of gaming on young people vary widely, depending on demographics and personal experiences with games. While some researchers have found that gaming has social and cognitive benefits, others have gone as far as to argue that it contributes to mass-shooting events. The question then is -- does playing violent video games lead to aggression?\n\nThe impact of video games on individuals and society is a topic that has been debated by scholars and professionals for many years. There is still no consensus, however, on whether playing violent video causes aggression. In such cases, policy-makers are typically cautious where scientific knowledge about something new is lacking. In accordance with this logic, groups such as the American Psychological Association have warned people to limit how much time they spend playing video games. The Australian and Swedish governments, however, have concluded there is no evidence that youth aggression is caused by gaming.\n\nThe most widely accepted theory to explain the link between violent video game engagement and aggression is called the general aggression model (GAM). The general aggression model proposes that repeated exposure to violent media increases the accessibility of aggressive thoughts, which in turn increases the probability of an individual exhibiting aggressive cognitive schema and behavior. The available evidence using the general aggression model to study the effect of playing violent video games on aggression has provided mixed support. More recently, researchers have criticised the use of the general aggression model, suggesting that there are multiple factors key to understanding the relationship between playing violent video games and aggression that are overlooked when adopting such an approach. For example, that people with aggressive tendencies are attracted to violent video games, and that games may elicit aggression in experimental settings not because they prime those schema but rather frustrate players' need for competence. \n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/game-performance-exercise.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/game-performance-exercise.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/game-performance-exercise.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/game-performance-exercise"},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"date":"2022-05-20","excerpt":"Some of you may know that one of our co-programme leads, Lee Cumbers, used to work in the fitness industry.

Whether exercise is carried out through sport, at the gym, outdoor activities or even at home, elevating your heart rate and getting the body moving is an essential part of living a healthy lifestyle. \n\n![](/images/man-experiencing-vr-simulation-entertainment-technology.jpg)\n\nConventional benefits aside, what if I told you that regular, structured exercise could improve your gaming performance, and prevent injuries or ailments that come as a result of prolonged gaming time?\n\nGamers in the aggregate have a poor relationship with exercise, mostly due to the sedentary nature of the activity. However, this stereotype is somewhat broken when looking at professional Esports players. Pro-gamers are starting to incorporate exercise into their daily routines because of the numerous physiological and psychological benefits that can improve performance, such as: \n\n*   Improved posture\n\n*   Increased muscle mass\n\n*   Prevention of Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI)\n\n*   Prevention of physiological conditions e.g. Type-2 Diabetes\n\n*   Increased energy levels\n\n*   Increased self-confidence\n\n*   Reduced stress\n\n*   Reduced mental health issues e.g. Depression\n\n*   Elevated mood\n\n*   Improved cognitive functioning\n\nCognitive functioning refers to multiple mental abilities; including learning, thinking, reasoning, remembering, problem solving, decision-making and attention. All of these factors contribute to in-game performance. By implementing an exercise regime, you could see an improvement in your personal performance, and skyrocket your rank and MMR! \n\nPublic Health England recommends at least 150 minutes of exercise per week (that’s only 4 Counter-Strike games per week!) involving a combination of aerobic exercise (e.g. jogging, cycling, swimming) and full-body resistance training (e.g. free weights, resistance machines, bands). \n\nSpecifically, postural retraining focuses on exercises that target your core, shoulders and back muscles. If you feel like your posture may be inadequate, and you find sitting down for long periods at your desk uncomfortable, this would be a good place to start. Improving your posture can reduce and prevent RSIs from occurring, while increasing your overall physical wellbeing. \n\nAdditionally, breaking up sedentary time with exercise or active rest periods has also been shown to improve physical wellbeing. While standing up from your desk and walking around has been recommended to prevent the negative effects of prolonged sitting. Calisthenics (bodyweight movements such as squats) are considered the most effective form of energy expenditure. These can be done anywhere, require little space, and no equipment is necessary. \n\nIn my opinion, implementing moderate aerobic exercise (outside if you’re able to) and a routine of calisthenic exercises is the best place to start if you’re looking to add exercise into your daily lifestyle. Once you become more comfortable and confident with exercise, seeking out a sporting club, activity centre or gym would be the next step. If you’re looking for information and advice along your exercise pathway, researching online using reliable sources and seeking help from accredited professionals will facilitate you utilising your time effectively, and exercising as efficiently and safely as possible. \n\nSo start working those muscles, and flex on your opponents in-game! \n\nSources: Public Health England. [Tulder, Malmiraara & Koes (2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1895638/).[ Carter, Jones & Gladwell (2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25816733/)). [Pirries & Lodewky (2012).](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1755296612000129?via%3Dihub)\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/gaming-addiction.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/gaming-addiction.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/gaming-addiction.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/gaming-addiction"},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"date":"2022-10-19","excerpt":"It’s estimated that 60 million people are experiencing gaming addiction.

One of the ways people are staying connected is through online gaming. Online gaming is an ideal way to combat social isolation and connect with others, even during times when it's difficult or impossible to be in close physical proximity. This article will discuss how online gaming can help people overcome social isolation and provide some tips for getting the most out of your online gaming experience.\n\nSocial isolation is a serious issue faced by many people in our society. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including mental health issues, physical disabilities, lack of access to social activities, and shyness. People who are socially isolated can feel lonely, have low self-esteem, and experience depression. It is important for those affected by social isolation to seek help from friends, family, and other support systems. Additionally, seeking professional help from a mental health professional can be beneficial to those struggling with social isolation.\n\nOnline gaming has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its convenience and availability. Players are able to connect with one another online and engage in interactive gaming experiences from the comfort of their home. Online gaming provides an opportunity for players to interact with others while playing their favorite games. Many games also offer opportunities for players to join teams or leagues and compete against each other. Online gaming also offers an escape from the everyday stresses of life and a chance for players to relax and have fun with friends or strangers alike.\n\n## Reasons for Social Isolation\n\nA lack of social skills can make it difficult for an individual to form meaningful relationships with others. Without these basic skills, individuals may find it hard to interact with peers and make connections that could potentially lead to a sense of belonging. Self-consciousness can also be a major barrier for those wanting to engage in social activities with others. By feeling uncomfortable or anxious in certain situations, such as speaking in a large group, individuals can be reluctant to reach out and socialize with those around them. Limited opportunities for socialization can also contribute to feelings of isolation as access to events such as parties or gatherings may be restricted due to financial or geographical constraints. In these cases, individuals may feel excluded from the wider community and their peers which can result in loneliness and depression.\n\n## Benefits of Online Gaming\n\nIncreased Confidence and Self-Esteem – Online gaming can help individuals develop better communication skills, which in turn, can help boost their confidence and self-esteem when interacting with others. By playing online games, players are able to practice how to communicate effectively with others in various contexts. This helps them become more comfortable in making conversation, expressing opinions and resolving conflicts. It also gives them a sense of accomplishment when they achieve their goals or overcome obstacles within the game. This encourages players to take on new challenges that may come up in real life situations as well as online environments.\n\nOpportunity to Develop and Practice Social Skills – Online gaming provides players with an opportunity to develop and practice social skills such as communication, collaboration, decision-making and problem solving. Through interactions with other players from around the world, they are able to gain experience on how to work together towards a common goal or objective while respecting each other’s opinions. This can be beneficial when trying to build relationships with others both online and offline as it teaches them how to effectively communicate and cooperate with one another.\n\nAbility To Connect With Others From Around The World – Online gaming has a global reach which allows people from different countries to connect with one another through various platforms such as forums or chat rooms. Through these platforms, players are able to share experiences, ideas and opinions regardless of their location or language barriers that may exist in real life settings. This gives gamers the chance to learn about different cultures and make meaningful connections from around the world which is an invaluable experience that can be difficult to come by in everyday life.\n\n## Different Types Of Online Games Available And How They Help Overcome Social Isolation\n\na.

Everyone can benefit from better sleep, and sleep hygiene can play a key part in achieving that goal. This is especially important as sleep is closely connected to mental health and has demonstrated links to depression and other mental health conditions. Previously, sleeping problems were seen as a result of depression, but growing evidence suggests that poor sleep may be a cause of depression.\n\n![](/images/sleep%20copy.jpg)\n\nSo! Sleep hygiene is crucial in improving mental health and it can be achieved by following a few rules:\n\n*   Avoid exposure to blue light before bed - blue light, in the form of screens, disrupts sleep by lowering melatonin levels. Normally, melatonin levels begin to rise in the mid- to late evening, remain high for most of the night, and then drop in the early morning hours. However, blue light from phones, tablets, computer screens or TV can boost alertness and alter our circadian rhythm (or internal clock) by fooling the brain into thinking that it’s still daytime. Cut down your exposure to unnatural light an hour before bed and no screen time 30 minutes before bed.\n\n*   Alcohol - Perhaps the most misunderstood drug when it comes to sleep. Alcohol is part of the sedative family of drugs. The old wives tale of a ‘night cap’ does not work to put you to sleep but sedates you. It knocks your brain out and stops natural sleep. This is different to normal sleep as the body struggles to work through it’s typical sleep cycles. You spend less time in a deep sleep and more time in less restful REM stages of sleep. Leaving you feeling tired the next day regardless of the time you have spent in bed.\n\n*   Caffeine - Caffeine has a 6 hour half-life - you may be unaware of the effect. It has a similar effect to alcohol in causing you to spend less time in a deep sleep and more time in less restful REM stages of sleep. So, two or three doses of coffee even 6 hours before bedtime could cost you upto to an hour’s sleep. It is important to note caffeine does not just come in the form of coffee or traditional black tea. It can be found in energy drinks (Monster and Red Bull) and green tea. Look to decaffeinated options and try to avoid caffeine after midday. \n\n*   Set Your Sleep Schedule\n\n*   This means having a fixed wake-up time regardless of the day whether it’s weekday or weekend.\n\n*   Prioritise sleep! \n\n*   It may seem tempting to game for hours into the night and into early morning but it is vital that you treat sleep as a priority. If you calculate a target bedtime based on your fixed wake-up time, ensure you are ready for bed by that time. For example, if you want to wake up at 8AM and want 8 hours of sleep, make sure you are in bed by 12PM without having looked at a screen (TV,Monitor,Phone) for at least 30 minutes as the blue light emitted from the screen causes poor sleep. \n\n*   Don’t Toss and Turn:\n\n*   It helps to have a connection between being in bed and being asleep. Therefore, if after 20 minutes and you haven’t gotten to sleep yet, try getting up and stretching or reading or anything calming in low light before trying to sleep again. However, try to not use a screen to do this.\n\n*   Incorporating Positive Routines during the day\n\n*   Get Daylight Exposure\n\n*   Be Physically Active\n\n*   Dont Smoke\n\n*   Reduce Alcohol consumption\n\n*   Reduce Caffeine consumption especially in the afternoon and evening\n\n*   Don’t eat too late\n\nIf you can follow the majority of these rules, usually your sleep will become deeper and more refreshing, however it isn’t the same for everyone, so try and find what works for you and if you have long-lasting or severe sleeping problems or daytime sleepiness, it’s best to talk with a doctor who can recommend the most appropriate course of treatment.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/suicidal-thoughts.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/suicidal-thoughts.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/suicidal-thoughts.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/suicidal-thoughts"},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"title":"Understanding Suicidal Thoughts","date":"2022-10-20","excerpt":"Suicidal thoughts can come from many different places and can be caused by a variety of elements...","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/depressed-suicidal-man-thinking-2021-08-26-23-02-50-utc.jpg","altText":"Suicidal thoughts","caption":""},"bottomSections":[{"type":"TextSection","elementId":"","colors":"colors-a","subtitle":"","text":"<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_jE7cbitjk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n\n","styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"full","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-0","pb-0","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"left"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"left"},"text":{"textAlign":"center"}}},{"type":"TextSection","elementId":"","colors":"colors-a","subtitle":"","text":"Suicidal thoughts are often a response to wanting to free ourselves from some form of pain or to lift a perceived sense of burden.

If you’re having thoughts about suicide, it is common to feel shame or worry that there is something wrong with you. Thoughts can pop into our mind without warning. There is no need to feel shame and having such thoughts does not mean there is something wrong with you.\n\nSometimes suicidal thoughts are drawn from fleeting emotions that are short-lived. If we find ourselves in a situation where we feel trapped, angry or uncomfortable. In these situations, it is normal to briefly think about taking your own life. They're quite common and as long as they're not too intense or persistent, you shouldn’t be overly worried. However, if the suicidal thoughts begin to spiral or you find yourself obsessing about your thoughts, you should talk to someone about your feelings.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/the-causes-of-suicide.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/the-causes-of-suicide.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/the-causes-of-suicide.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/the-causes-of-suicide"},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"date":"2022-10-19","excerpt":"The most common way that people talk about suicide focuses on the individual’s mental health.

Clinical depression is positively correlated with suicide, but mental health isn't the only factor involved in suicidal thoughts or attempts. The biomedical model of suicide states that psychiatric pathologies and inadequate treatment of depression are the main causes. While still the dominant view, this model of depression is increasingly being challenged by studies that suggest there may be other causes for the condition. Depression is now widely seen as a complex disorder with multiple contributing factors, rather than the simple chemical imbalance originally described in the 1960s.\n\nIf the causes of depression — and by extension suicide — are not solely in a person’s brain chemistry, what else could contribute? In short, depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. Many of the causes are well known—childhood trauma, family history and recreational drug use being among them. It is important to understand that suicide rarely results from one cause. Many factors—which interact with each other in complex ways—contribute to suicidal behavior.

It is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness. Depression can also lead to physical symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, and loss of appetite.\n\nThere are many potential causes of depression, including genetic predisposition, brain chemistry, and life events. Depression is often triggered by a stressful event, such as the death of a loved one, financial problems, or relationship difficulties. It can also be caused by medical conditions such as chronic pain or an imbalance of hormones.\n\n![](/images/man-on-the-pier-young-man-stands-on-a-wooden-pier-2022-11-02-16-32-25-utc-min.jpg)\n\n## Causes of Depression\n\nDepression is treatable with medication, therapy, and self-care. If you are struggling with depression, please know that you are not alone and there is help available. In this article, we will discuss the five main causes of depression.\n\n1.  Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.\n\n2.  Depression can be caused by a traumatic event or experience.\n\n3.  Depression can be caused by genetic factors.\n\n4.  Depression can be caused by chronic stress or anxiety.\n\n5.  Depression can be caused by certain medical conditions.\n\n*Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.*\n\nThe most common theory about the cause of depression is that it is due to a chemical imbalance in the brain. This theory suggests that people who are depressed have abnormal levels of certain chemicals, such as serotonin and norepinephrine. These chemicals are involved in regulating mood, and an imbalance can lead to feelings of sadness and despair. There is some evidence to support this theory, but it is still not fully understood how or why these imbalances occur.\n\n*Depression can be caused by a traumatic event or experience.*\n\nAnother theory about the cause of depression is that it can be triggered by a traumatic event or experience. This could be something like the death of a loved one, a divorce, or losing a job. People who have experienced trauma may be more likely to develop depression, especially if they do not have a strong support system to help them cope.\n\n*Depression can be caused by genetic factors.*\n\nDepression can also run in families, which suggests that there may be a genetic component to the condition. Studies of twins have shown that people with a family history of depression are more likely to develop the condition themselves. This does not mean that depression is inevitable if you have a family member who is affected, but it does increase your risk.\n\n*Depression can be caused by chronic stress or anxiety.*\n\nChronic stress and anxiety can also lead to depression. Stressful life events, such as financial problems or relationship difficulties, can trigger an episode of depression. Once someone is depressed, they may become more sensitive to stress and find it harder to cope, which can make the condition worse.\n\n*Depression can be caused by certain medical conditions.*\n\nThere are also some medical conditions that can cause or contribute to depression. These include thyroid problems, anemia, and vitamin deficiencies. Depression is also common in people who have chronic pain or other physical illnesses.\n\n## How is depression treated?\n\nThere are many ways that people with depression can get help. Some people need medication to feel better, but many people with depression can get better without medication. Some people need to see a therapist or counselor, and some people just need to make some changes in their life, like getting more exercise or spending time with friends. Typically, depression is treated by combining multiple approaches and is often most effective when treated in partnership with the patient. \n\n\\-Antidepressants\\\n\\-Counseling or therapy\\\n\\-Exercise\\\n\\-Dietary changes\\\n\\-Meditation\n\n*Antidepressants*\n\nThe goal of antidepressant medication is to restore the chemical balance of neurotransmitters in your brain. Although antidepressants are designed to treat depression, they are often prescribed for anxiety as well.\n\n*Counseling or therapy*\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy that can be effective in treating anxiety disorders. CBT focuses on identifying, understanding, and changing thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety.\n\n*Exercise*\n\nRegular exercise can help reduce the symptoms of anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are hormones that boost mood. Exercise can also help to reduce stress and improve sleep.\n\n*Dietary changes*\n\nEating a healthy diet and avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and sugar can help to reduce the symptoms of anxiety. Eating a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can also help to improve mood and reduce stress.\n\n*Meditation*\n\nMeditation is a relaxation technique that can help to calm the mind and body. Meditation can be done for a few minutes at a time, and there are many different ways to meditate.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are many different theories about the cause of depression, but the truth is that it is probably a combination of factors. Some people may be more vulnerable to developing depression due to genetic factors, while others may experience it after a traumatic event. Chronic stress and anxiety can also contribute to the condition. Whatever the cause, it is important to remember that depression is a real illness that can be treated.\n\nMood disorders like depression are characterized by feelings of hopelessness and a loss of enjoyment.

In 2022 alone, we have seen a number of high profile streamers discuss how they have burnout. But what is streamer burnout and how can we recognise it? \n\nStarting out as a streamer is full of possibility and excitement. You’re energised thinking about the content you’re going to create. You go live and then everything changes. Maybe you explode and the pressures of maintaining that popularity pile on. Perhaps the feedback comes flooding in and you feel you have to make changes. Maybe no one comes to your stream or watches your videos. Either way, over time, the pressures placed on you to adapt can strip away the enjoyment. As time goes by, you feel your energy drain. It’s like your thoughts are getting slower and you feel emotionally fragile. Are these feelings caused by what you have eaten for breakfast or the previous night’s poor sleep? Maybe, but if these feelings last in time, then I am sorry to say they could be symptoms of burnout. \n\nBurnout is defined as a state of physical and emotional exhaustion. Burnout typically occurs when experiencing long-term stress in your job, or when you have worked in a physically or emotionally draining role for a long time. Whilst many of you may not recognise these factors when streaming, others will. It takes an emotional toll to present yourself to others for hours on end. In psychological terms this is called emotional labour. More on this later. \n\n### Why streamer burnout happens?\n\n“Burnout is an incredibly real thing in streaming,” says Imane Anys, AKA [Pokimane](https://www.twitch.tv/pokimane?lang=it), who became the most popular female streamer on Twitch, with 9.2 million subscribers. She described on her secondary channel how she had to take a pause from [Twitch to deal with burnout.](https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/pokimane-to-step-back-from-the-rat-race-of-twitch-streaming-3303210) “I recognize I’m very lucky to be able to work, however, I need to do what’s best for my mental health,” Pokimane explained. “A streamer sets their own work hours and it can be easy to fall into the trap of streaming eight to 12 hours a day, seven days a week. It’s frightening because people grind crazy long hours and see results – hence why so many do it.”\n\n![](/images/Pokimane-2022.jpeg)\n\nYou may see the signs of burnout in yourself or the streamers you watch. [Signs](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2018/02/ce-corner#:~:text=According%20to%20psychologist%20Christina%20Maslach,lack%20of%20accomplishment%20\\(%20Maslach%20Burnout) such as Physical and emotional exhaustion, Cynicism about the work, Detachment or alienation from work-related activities, Headaches or stomach aches, Reduced creativity, Depression, and Difficulty sleeping, eating or generally caring for yourself are common. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, burnout and emotional labour are often positively correlated. [Ashforth and Humphrey](https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMR.1993.3997508) defined emotional labour as “the act of displaying appropriate emotions, with the goal to engage in a form of impression management”. For streamers, this is the act of creating an impression in the minds of their audience. Perhaps streamers wish to appear competent at a game, attractive and desirable, humorous or any number of the positive ways we seek to present ourselves to others. Presenting an impression for long periods of time, however, can be exhausting. Think about the last time you took a flight. Consider the behaviour of the flight attendant or pilot who supported you. Within such roles, staff are expected to smile, be attentive, and calm. It’s understandable. No one wants to be sat in a tin can that’s about to fly at thousands of feet and hear the pilot crying over the intercom system. Your life is in that person’s hands and they have to present an impression of calm competence. Suppressing your emotion to present an expected impression takes an emotional toll. Just like the actors playing perfect Disney Princesses for eight hours a day seven days a week at Disney World, many streamers will feel they need to present a version of self. Even if it’s not drastically different from the version of you without a camera in your face, there is still a knowledge that what you say and do will be in the public domain. It is natural to want to want to create a positive impression, but it’s important to realise that this type of interaction can take an emotional toll. \n\n### TIPS TO AVOID BURNOUT\n\nIn a statement to provide support for streamer’s mental health, Twitch said that they are “developing targeted programming to support content creators with challenges like burnout, boundary-setting, and other pressures that come with a career in online content creation.\"\\* \\*Whilst they figure this out, here are some tips that we suggest to avoid streamer burnout:\n\nStreaming should be part of the routine, but not your life: As ZeaIand, a streamer on Twitch with almost 100,000 followers, said on our [previous interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEf-dFFrYFw)\\* \\*“the nature of content creation is that every single person that does it, has to find their own way to deal with it, and find a workload they are comfortable with. The best you can do is **educate people on what they can do to take care of themselves.**” \n\nPokimane explained how she dealt with her burnout, caused by, what she feels, are the “insane amount of hours” she streams. By [spending time with her family and friends](https://youtu.be/KRK3s-X-QzM?t=213). “I’ve veered away from doing extreme hours of live streaming in an effort to upkeep my mental health and I’ve found that it aids in the longevity of my career”, she stated after her decision to take a pause from work. You need to **connect with your ‘offline’ life** and take a break from constantly worrying about work. Creating a plan for your whole day could help keeping track of the hours that you dedicate to streaming. \n\nJob crafting: by improving and making more interesting your own work you can have a better performance. Job crafting is a creative process regarding the strategies that are done by the workers to adapt to the request from the job. An example could be to **develop a new skill** by changing the type of game that you typically play or streaming about something else entirely. \n\nDo physical activity, eat well and have a regular sleep pattern: when you lack sleep and proper nutrition, when you are constantly in a sitting position for many hours, it is going to be difficult to have the energy to do the things you wanted to do. Physical activity helps you **release endorphins** (produce a feeling of euphoria), eating well and getting enough sleep will **give you the energy** to sustain your working hour. The latter may be especially difficult to maintain for the streamers since some tend to stream during night-time. These aspects will help you to be more focus the next day and be more creative.**A positive mindset brings positive things**: Another thing that could lead to burnout are *trolls*. Many streamers experience burnout because they tend to focus only on the negative comments that came over continuously, and it’s mentally draining.

It is estimated that 1 in 6 people would have experienced a common mental health problem in the past week (mentalhealth.org). Mental health issues are also one of the main causes of the overall disease burden worldwide, meaning it’s one of the biggest impactors of health and wellbeing on the global population.\n\nRecent research has shown that gaming can have a positive effect on wellbeing. A study conducted at the University of Oxford found playing video games is positively correlated with overall wellbeing. (<https://psyarxiv.com/qrjza>). Policy makers around the world have been contemplating the regulation of video game playing time and its overall influence on wellbeing, even though there isn’t enough adequate data to justify these notions, and the findings revealed so far support the idea that gaming may actually facilitate positive mental health.\n\nSo here’s a few benefits that video gaming can have on your mental health:\n\nVideo games lead to healthy brain stimulation- Most games promote the stimulation and use of many different areas in the brain, such as problem solving, decision-making, pattern recognition, and many more. It also provokes multiple dimensions of critical thinking and improves analytical skills. In part 3 of the series, we’ll be going into much more detail regarding these aspects.\n\nPlaying games can help relieve stress- Immersing yourself into an RPG, working through an action-adventure franchise, or battling against others online are excellent ways to relinquish stress. Gaming is an interactive and diverse tool for unwinding, and promotes ‘positive escapism’- taking a break from reality in order to decompress from a rough day or week, and providing an opportunity to gain some perspective on the daily stresses of life.\n\nVideo games can help you develop coping strategies- When faced with a difficult life situation, people tend to use coping mechanisms in order to deal with the obstacles they’re facing. While some of these mechanisms can be negative, such as abusing drugs and alcohol, gaming incites opportunities to learn how to effectively cope with real-life difficulties by overcoming virtual adversities, invoking perseverance and promoting a sense of achievement.\n\nIntertwining with mental health is ‘social connection’, which is defined as: “The relationships you have with the people around you”. They may be close by such as family, friends and co-workers, or far away, meaning you only connect with them over the phone or online.\n\nHaving social connections with others in any form are important for a variety of reasons. One of the main outcomes is the development of ‘Resilience’ which is the ability to bounce back after stressful situations, this is strengthened when you give and receive social support. Support from your social connections can also contribute to feelings of purpose and meaning in life. Being there for others, and having people you can turn to when in need are pivotal for improving and maintaining wellbeing.\n\nIn light of recent years, social connection has become more important than ever before. Video games are arguably the best platform for socialising and maintaining relationships. Communication is a constant when gaming online, and creates an almost perfect environment for different capacities of conversations to be shared among friends or new people.\n\nGaming and livestreaming are effective ways to combat loneliness. Loneliness is the perceived feeling of being alone or isolated, regardless of what social connections you have. This modern way of socialising with people who share similar interests and affinities can help overcome the feeling of being alone, while becoming part of a genuinely supportive community.\n\nThere are many different ways to create social connections through gaming, this could be something like joining an esports team or league, playing MMORPGS and other games that involve teamwork and large-scale interaction, or playing online games in general where matchmaking connects you to thousands of people across the World. The possibilities of meeting new people, and staying connected with old friends are endless, and video games make it effortless and enjoyable.\n\nIn summary, playing games in moderation can be an effective way to improve and maintain positive mental wellbeing. The empirical research being conducted supports the idea that video games are actually a useful tool for mental health, going against the baseless statements of policy makers and government officials. Forming and maintaining social connection with others has never been easier through gaming, meeting like minded people at the touch of a key or button promotes the generation of new relationships through fun and enjoyable experiences that bring people together from across the World.\n","styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"narrow","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-1","pb-24","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"left"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"left"},"text":{"textAlign":"left"}},"title":"Can Gaming Make You Smarter?"},{"type":"FeaturedPostsSection","elementId":"","showDate":false,"showAuthor":false,"showExcerpt":false,"variant":"variant-b","actions":[],"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-12","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}},"subtitle":"FEATURED ARTICLES","colors":"colors-a","posts":["content/pages/blog/does-playing-violent-video-games-cause-aggression.md","content/pages/blog/suicidal-thoughts.md"]},{"type":"ContactSection","elementId":"","colors":"colors-c","backgroundSize":"full","title":"INSPIRING IDEAS AND MEANINGFUL ACTION","text":"Join our monthly newsletter to get early access to our content, courses, and more.\n","form":{"variant":"variant-b","fields":[{"name":"email","placeholder":"Your email","isRequired":"true","width":"full","type":"EmailFormControl"}],"submitLabel":"STAY IN THE LOOP","elementId":"newsletter","action":"/.netlify/functions/submission_created","destination":"team@playaid.net","type":"FormBlock"},"media":null,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"narrow","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-24","pb-20","pl-4","pr-4"],"alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center","flexDirection":"row"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"text":{"textAlign":"center"}}}],"title":"Can Gaming Make You Smarter?","date":"2022-11-02","markdown_content":null},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/dark-side-gaming.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/dark-side-gaming.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/dark-side-gaming.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/dark-side-gaming","pageCssClasses":["page-blog","page-blog-dark-side-gaming"]},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"title":"The Dark Side of Gaming","date":"2022-06-16","excerpt":"Nunc rutrum felis dui, ut consequat sapien scelerisque vel.

Proposing that video games can lead to laziness, aggressiveness and even violent behaviour. However, due to the unstoppable growth of gaming and its firm implementation into modern society, whether many media outlets like it or not, video games are here to stay. \n\nLike with most things, an unjust negative outlook on a particular topic is usually formed due to misinformation and lack of understanding. The somewhat one-sided viewpoint of video games has left a skewed perspective in the eyes of parents, government and health officials. We have attempted to take a critical look at the evidence with a view of providing a more nuanced and balanced perspective of the pros and cons of gaming. In this three part series, we will present the outcome of this investigation. \n\nBefore we dive into the numerous benefits of picking up a gamepad, or using your keyboard and mouse for more than just work and internet surfing, let’s take a look at the perceived negative aspects of gaming. While some are truthful, there are others that are not backed up by empirical research or data. For example:\n\nThe notion that violent video games cause violent behaviour is completely anecdotal. Academic research shows no correlation of violent games inciting real life violent behaviour, in fact, it’s quite the opposite. Video games of any genre have been shown to reduce stress, facilitate relaxation, and regulate emotions. \n\nAfter decades of this completely farcical narrative being pushed in the mainstream media, one game developer company decided to hit back. Rockstar games, the creators of the Grand Theft Auto series, were scrutinised by no other than Hillary Clinton, due to the violent and profane nature of the game franchise. Clinton suggested that new regulations should be introduced to combat games like this. Rockstar subtly responded when they released GTA 4 in 2008, the fictional setting for the game is ‘Liberty City’, which shares strong similarities with New York city, including their very own Statue of Liberty, referred to as the Statue of Happiness. Upon closer inspection, the face of ‘Lady happiness’ shares a striking resemblance to Hillary Clinton. Although Rockstar Games have never confirmed the reference or intent behind this easter egg, it was revealed that the file name for the statue is “stat_hilberty01.wdr”. So you can decide for yourselves. \n\nAnother misconception is that video games are a waste of time, and provide no progression in regard to personal and societal development. Once again this couldn’t be further from the truth. Professional gamers are paid annual salaries, receive bonuses, sponsorship money and donations from fans. Professional streamers are essentially entertainers, they can vary from elite gameplay, comedy, interactive and supportive content. Their revenue streams are very similar, and tend to lead into other career pathways such as esports coaching, presenting and hosting podcasts. In 2021, a streamer by the name of CriticalRole made 9 million dollars just from his live stream alone. Later in the series, we’ll be looking at the plethora of benefits gaming has to offer when it comes to personal and career development. \n\nHowever, this isn’t going to be a one-sided affair, there are some negative elements of gaming that are supported with evidence. The sedentary nature of video gaming is usually the first aspect mentioned. And Yes. Gaming is for the most part an inactive hobby (with the exception of some VR games). However, finding a balance between adequate physical activity and sedentary recreational time is essential when it comes to any hobby. \n\nAdditionally, using video games as a form of negative escapism can also be detrimental to your health. Gaming can become a reliance, and even addictive. Internet Gaming disorder (or IDG) involves an unhealthy fixation on playing games, subsequently causing other aspects of life to fall by the way-side. Behaviours include a preoccupation with gaming, withdrawal symptoms when gaming is taken away or not possible, and continuing to game despite problems.\n\nLike everything, though, too much of something good can lead to undesirable outcomes. Prioritising video games over essential activities such as sleep, nutrition, and physical activity can be damaging to your physical and mental wellbeing. What seems to be often overlooked is the fact that video games are merely a tool just like anything else. It’s no different to exercising, watching films and TV shows, or even reading books. Doing any activity to excess can be harmful to your health, even the ones with positive connotations. For example, if you exercise excessively, you can cause your physical and mental health to decline over time. If you spent all your time reading, and sacrificed sleep, eating and physical activity as a result, that would also be bad for your wellbeing. \n\nIn summary, video games have been given a bad wrap over the years, but the powers that be are not telling both sides of the story. Nevertheless, this stigmatisation hasn’t managed to stop the gaming scene from becoming one of the biggest conglomerates in the world. As long as a healthy balance is achieved and maintained, video games can provide a plethora of mental, developmental, and social benefits. \n\nIn Part 2, we’ll be taking a look at the ways gaming can facilitate positive mental wellbeing and social connection, hit the subscribe button to be notified, and check out our website for more information on gaming and health. \n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/dezachu.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/dezachu.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/dezachu.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/dezachu","pageCssClasses":["page-blog","page-blog-dezachu"]},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"title":"Dezachu on Shout-casting and Mental Health in Rainbow Six and League of Legends","date":"2022-05-22","excerpt":"Many of us dream about a career in Esports and getting paid to do what we love, maybe shout casting could be for for you?

Broadly speaking, the best available evidence does not support the position that playing violent video games is related to aggressive behaviour. The evidence also suggests that the amount of time a teenager spends playing violent video games does not predict whether or not he will engage in aggressive behaviour. However, it is important to note that some mechanics and situations in gaming cause players to feel angry. Some examples include feeling incompetent, trash talking or competing with other players during gameplay. These are still important and under researched topics that have direct implications on antisocial online behaviours such as bullying, trolling and griefing. However, there is limited evidence to suggest these behaviours transcend into off-line settings. \n\nDespite the evidence, it will likely remain an unsettled question for parents, pundits and policy-makers whether violent video games drive aggressive behavior. For us, video games are just the latest medium to come under media scrutiny. History tells us that cinema and even books have been subjected to similar concerns. This is not to say that the immersive nature of video games may not affect people differently, but to provide a wider context that these are not new concerns. Whilst the focus in the media has been on the perceived relationship between playing violent video games and violent behaviour, less focus has been on the positives. The social benefits are now well established and psychological benefits are emerging. However, most of these relationships are mediated by, to some extent, individual differences in the players. We argue that the effect of video games on a person's well-being is dependent on multiple factors, including the type or style of game being played, the motivation behind its use, and moderation in gameplay. \n","styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"narrow","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-6","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"left"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"left"},"text":{"textAlign":"left"}}},{"type":"FeaturedPostsSection","elementId":"","showDate":false,"showAuthor":false,"showExcerpt":false,"variant":"variant-b","actions":[],"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-12","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}},"subtitle":"Featured Articles","colors":"colors-a","posts":["content/pages/blog/does-playing-violent-video-games-cause-aggression.md","content/pages/blog/suicidal-thoughts.md"]},{"type":"ContactSection","elementId":"","colors":"colors-c","backgroundSize":"full","title":"INSPIRING IDEAS AND MEANINGFUL ACTION","text":"Join our monthly newsletter to get early access to our research, advocacy work, courses and more.\n","form":{"variant":"variant-b","fields":[{"name":"email","placeholder":"Your email","isRequired":"true","width":"full","type":"EmailFormControl"}],"submitLabel":"STAY IN THE LOOP","elementId":"newsletter","action":"/.netlify/functions/submission_created","destination":"team@playaid.net","type":"FormBlock"},"media":null,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"narrow","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-24","pb-20","pl-4","pr-4"],"alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center","flexDirection":"row"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"text":{"textAlign":"center"}}}],"markdown_content":"![](/images/GTA-V-Trevor-Philips-Lake-Body.jpg)\n\nMost young people in the developed world play video games. Many play violent video games. Since the inception of gaming as a recreational activity there have been concerns about possible negative effects. Studies polling members of the general public as well as scientists suggest that views concerning the effects of gaming on young people vary widely, depending on demographics and personal experiences with games. While some researchers have found that gaming has social and cognitive benefits, others have gone as far as to argue that it contributes to mass-shooting events. The question then is -- does playing violent video games lead to aggression?\n\nThe impact of video games on individuals and society is a topic that has been debated by scholars and professionals for many years. There is still no consensus, however, on whether playing violent video causes aggression. In such cases, policy-makers are typically cautious where scientific knowledge about something new is lacking. In accordance with this logic, groups such as the American Psychological Association have warned people to limit how much time they spend playing video games. The Australian and Swedish governments, however, have concluded there is no evidence that youth aggression is caused by gaming.\n\nThe most widely accepted theory to explain the link between violent video game engagement and aggression is called the general aggression model (GAM). The general aggression model proposes that repeated exposure to violent media increases the accessibility of aggressive thoughts, which in turn increases the probability of an individual exhibiting aggressive cognitive schema and behavior. The available evidence using the general aggression model to study the effect of playing violent video games on aggression has provided mixed support. More recently, researchers have criticised the use of the general aggression model, suggesting that there are multiple factors key to understanding the relationship between playing violent video games and aggression that are overlooked when adopting such an approach. For example, that people with aggressive tendencies are attracted to violent video games, and that games may elicit aggression in experimental settings not because they prime those schema but rather frustrate players' need for competence. \n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/game-performance-exercise.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/game-performance-exercise.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/game-performance-exercise.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/game-performance-exercise","pageCssClasses":["page-blog","page-blog-game-performance-exercise"]},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"date":"2022-05-20","excerpt":"Some of you may know that one of our co-programme leads, Lee Cumbers, used to work in the fitness industry.

Whether exercise is carried out through sport, at the gym, outdoor activities or even at home, elevating your heart rate and getting the body moving is an essential part of living a healthy lifestyle. \n\n![](/images/man-experiencing-vr-simulation-entertainment-technology.jpg)\n\nConventional benefits aside, what if I told you that regular, structured exercise could improve your gaming performance, and prevent injuries or ailments that come as a result of prolonged gaming time?\n\nGamers in the aggregate have a poor relationship with exercise, mostly due to the sedentary nature of the activity. However, this stereotype is somewhat broken when looking at professional Esports players. Pro-gamers are starting to incorporate exercise into their daily routines because of the numerous physiological and psychological benefits that can improve performance, such as: \n\n*   Improved posture\n\n*   Increased muscle mass\n\n*   Prevention of Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI)\n\n*   Prevention of physiological conditions e.g. Type-2 Diabetes\n\n*   Increased energy levels\n\n*   Increased self-confidence\n\n*   Reduced stress\n\n*   Reduced mental health issues e.g. Depression\n\n*   Elevated mood\n\n*   Improved cognitive functioning\n\nCognitive functioning refers to multiple mental abilities; including learning, thinking, reasoning, remembering, problem solving, decision-making and attention. All of these factors contribute to in-game performance. By implementing an exercise regime, you could see an improvement in your personal performance, and skyrocket your rank and MMR! \n\nPublic Health England recommends at least 150 minutes of exercise per week (that’s only 4 Counter-Strike games per week!) involving a combination of aerobic exercise (e.g. jogging, cycling, swimming) and full-body resistance training (e.g. free weights, resistance machines, bands). \n\nSpecifically, postural retraining focuses on exercises that target your core, shoulders and back muscles. If you feel like your posture may be inadequate, and you find sitting down for long periods at your desk uncomfortable, this would be a good place to start. Improving your posture can reduce and prevent RSIs from occurring, while increasing your overall physical wellbeing. \n\nAdditionally, breaking up sedentary time with exercise or active rest periods has also been shown to improve physical wellbeing. While standing up from your desk and walking around has been recommended to prevent the negative effects of prolonged sitting. Calisthenics (bodyweight movements such as squats) are considered the most effective form of energy expenditure. These can be done anywhere, require little space, and no equipment is necessary. \n\nIn my opinion, implementing moderate aerobic exercise (outside if you’re able to) and a routine of calisthenic exercises is the best place to start if you’re looking to add exercise into your daily lifestyle. Once you become more comfortable and confident with exercise, seeking out a sporting club, activity centre or gym would be the next step. If you’re looking for information and advice along your exercise pathway, researching online using reliable sources and seeking help from accredited professionals will facilitate you utilising your time effectively, and exercising as efficiently and safely as possible. \n\nSo start working those muscles, and flex on your opponents in-game! \n\nSources: Public Health England. [Tulder, Malmiraara & Koes (2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1895638/).[ Carter, Jones & Gladwell (2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25816733/)). [Pirries & Lodewky (2012).](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1755296612000129?via%3Dihub)\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/gaming-addiction.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/gaming-addiction.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/gaming-addiction.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/gaming-addiction","pageCssClasses":["page-blog","page-blog-gaming-addiction"]},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"date":"2022-10-19","excerpt":"It’s estimated that 60 million people are experiencing gaming addiction.

One of the ways people are staying connected is through online gaming. Online gaming is an ideal way to combat social isolation and connect with others, even during times when it's difficult or impossible to be in close physical proximity. This article will discuss how online gaming can help people overcome social isolation and provide some tips for getting the most out of your online gaming experience.\n\nSocial isolation is a serious issue faced by many people in our society. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including mental health issues, physical disabilities, lack of access to social activities, and shyness. People who are socially isolated can feel lonely, have low self-esteem, and experience depression. It is important for those affected by social isolation to seek help from friends, family, and other support systems. Additionally, seeking professional help from a mental health professional can be beneficial to those struggling with social isolation.\n\nOnline gaming has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its convenience and availability. Players are able to connect with one another online and engage in interactive gaming experiences from the comfort of their home. Online gaming provides an opportunity for players to interact with others while playing their favorite games. Many games also offer opportunities for players to join teams or leagues and compete against each other. Online gaming also offers an escape from the everyday stresses of life and a chance for players to relax and have fun with friends or strangers alike.\n\n## Reasons for Social Isolation\n\nA lack of social skills can make it difficult for an individual to form meaningful relationships with others. Without these basic skills, individuals may find it hard to interact with peers and make connections that could potentially lead to a sense of belonging. Self-consciousness can also be a major barrier for those wanting to engage in social activities with others. By feeling uncomfortable or anxious in certain situations, such as speaking in a large group, individuals can be reluctant to reach out and socialize with those around them. Limited opportunities for socialization can also contribute to feelings of isolation as access to events such as parties or gatherings may be restricted due to financial or geographical constraints. In these cases, individuals may feel excluded from the wider community and their peers which can result in loneliness and depression.\n\n## Benefits of Online Gaming\n\nIncreased Confidence and Self-Esteem – Online gaming can help individuals develop better communication skills, which in turn, can help boost their confidence and self-esteem when interacting with others. By playing online games, players are able to practice how to communicate effectively with others in various contexts. This helps them become more comfortable in making conversation, expressing opinions and resolving conflicts. It also gives them a sense of accomplishment when they achieve their goals or overcome obstacles within the game. This encourages players to take on new challenges that may come up in real life situations as well as online environments.\n\nOpportunity to Develop and Practice Social Skills – Online gaming provides players with an opportunity to develop and practice social skills such as communication, collaboration, decision-making and problem solving. Through interactions with other players from around the world, they are able to gain experience on how to work together towards a common goal or objective while respecting each other’s opinions. This can be beneficial when trying to build relationships with others both online and offline as it teaches them how to effectively communicate and cooperate with one another.\n\nAbility To Connect With Others From Around The World – Online gaming has a global reach which allows people from different countries to connect with one another through various platforms such as forums or chat rooms. Through these platforms, players are able to share experiences, ideas and opinions regardless of their location or language barriers that may exist in real life settings. This gives gamers the chance to learn about different cultures and make meaningful connections from around the world which is an invaluable experience that can be difficult to come by in everyday life.\n\n## Different Types Of Online Games Available And How They Help Overcome Social Isolation\n\na. Role Playing Games (RPGs) – RPG’s are interactive stories that allow players take on roles within the game’s world while interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) as well as other players they meet along the way while completing tasks or missions together. By stepping into the shoes of a character, we are able to explore a virtual world and experiment with sides of our own personality. Through this type of game play players are able to build relationships with one another by working cooperatively towards a common goal while developing character traits such as empathy, negotiation skills and problem solving techniques all essential elements when forming meaningful connections both online and offline.  Players also get the opportunity to create meaningful connections with their fellow gamers as they work together towards common goals.\n\nb. Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs)– MMORPG’s are more complex versions RPG’s that involve multiple players joining forces in a large virtual world. MMORPGs provide an intense team-based experience where players develop strong bonds as they learn how to work together in order to overcome challenges within the game.  During the course of the game, players must cooperate and collaborate with one another in order to complete objectives, fight off enemies and adversaries, and build strategies for success.  This type game play enhances communication between players allowing them develop strong bonds through cooperation, collaboration, competition, strategy building, teamwork, and more.\n\n## Challenges Faced With Online Gaming\n\na Addiction to video games is a serious problem that can have devastating effects on people’s lives.

Everyone can benefit from better sleep, and sleep hygiene can play a key part in achieving that goal. This is especially important as sleep is closely connected to mental health and has demonstrated links to depression and other mental health conditions. Previously, sleeping problems were seen as a result of depression, but growing evidence suggests that poor sleep may be a cause of depression.\n\n![](/images/sleep%20copy.jpg)\n\nSo! Sleep hygiene is crucial in improving mental health and it can be achieved by following a few rules:\n\n*   Avoid exposure to blue light before bed - blue light, in the form of screens, disrupts sleep by lowering melatonin levels. Normally, melatonin levels begin to rise in the mid- to late evening, remain high for most of the night, and then drop in the early morning hours. However, blue light from phones, tablets, computer screens or TV can boost alertness and alter our circadian rhythm (or internal clock) by fooling the brain into thinking that it’s still daytime. Cut down your exposure to unnatural light an hour before bed and no screen time 30 minutes before bed.\n\n*   Alcohol - Perhaps the most misunderstood drug when it comes to sleep. Alcohol is part of the sedative family of drugs. The old wives tale of a ‘night cap’ does not work to put you to sleep but sedates you. It knocks your brain out and stops natural sleep. This is different to normal sleep as the body struggles to work through it’s typical sleep cycles. You spend less time in a deep sleep and more time in less restful REM stages of sleep. Leaving you feeling tired the next day regardless of the time you have spent in bed.\n\n*   Caffeine - Caffeine has a 6 hour half-life - you may be unaware of the effect. It has a similar effect to alcohol in causing you to spend less time in a deep sleep and more time in less restful REM stages of sleep. So, two or three doses of coffee even 6 hours before bedtime could cost you upto to an hour’s sleep. It is important to note caffeine does not just come in the form of coffee or traditional black tea. It can be found in energy drinks (Monster and Red Bull) and green tea. Look to decaffeinated options and try to avoid caffeine after midday. \n\n*   Set Your Sleep Schedule\n\n*   This means having a fixed wake-up time regardless of the day whether it’s weekday or weekend.\n\n*   Prioritise sleep! \n\n*   It may seem tempting to game for hours into the night and into early morning but it is vital that you treat sleep as a priority. If you calculate a target bedtime based on your fixed wake-up time, ensure you are ready for bed by that time. For example, if you want to wake up at 8AM and want 8 hours of sleep, make sure you are in bed by 12PM without having looked at a screen (TV,Monitor,Phone) for at least 30 minutes as the blue light emitted from the screen causes poor sleep. \n\n*   Don’t Toss and Turn:\n\n*   It helps to have a connection between being in bed and being asleep. Therefore, if after 20 minutes and you haven’t gotten to sleep yet, try getting up and stretching or reading or anything calming in low light before trying to sleep again. However, try to not use a screen to do this.\n\n*   Incorporating Positive Routines during the day\n\n*   Get Daylight Exposure\n\n*   Be Physically Active\n\n*   Dont Smoke\n\n*   Reduce Alcohol consumption\n\n*   Reduce Caffeine consumption especially in the afternoon and evening\n\n*   Don’t eat too late\n\nIf you can follow the majority of these rules, usually your sleep will become deeper and more refreshing, however it isn’t the same for everyone, so try and find what works for you and if you have long-lasting or severe sleeping problems or daytime sleepiness, it’s best to talk with a doctor who can recommend the most appropriate course of treatment.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/suicidal-thoughts.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/suicidal-thoughts.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/suicidal-thoughts.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/suicidal-thoughts","pageCssClasses":["page-blog","page-blog-suicidal-thoughts"]},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"addTitleSuffix":true,"socialImage":null,"metaTags":[],"title":"Understanding Suicidal Thoughts","date":"2022-10-20","excerpt":"Suicidal thoughts can come from many different places and can be caused by a variety of elements...","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/depressed-suicidal-man-thinking-2021-08-26-23-02-50-utc.jpg","altText":"Suicidal thoughts","caption":""},"bottomSections":[{"type":"TextSection","elementId":"","colors":"colors-a","subtitle":"","text":"<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_jE7cbitjk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n\n","styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"full","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-0","pb-0","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"left"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"left"},"text":{"textAlign":"center"}}},{"type":"TextSection","elementId":"","colors":"colors-a","subtitle":"","text":"Suicidal thoughts are often a response to wanting to free ourselves from some form of pain or to lift a perceived sense of burden.

Suicide leaves a devastating impact on families, friends, and communities.\n\nSuicidal thoughts may also stem from a lack of control. In situations where there appears to be no viable options, suicidal thoughts may present themselves as a solution. When we are in the midst of a crisis, it is hard to think clearly. Try to avoid making major decisions during periods of major distress. Even if it appears hopeless, there is always another way.\n\nTalking through the problem can help. Speaking to someone about how you feel can help you to break the cycle. Hearing someone you care about is having such thoughts or having them yourself can be alarming but try to stay calm.

The biomedical model of suicide states that psychiatric pathologies and inadequate treatment of depression are the main causes. While still the dominant view, this model of depression is increasingly being challenged by studies that suggest there may be other causes for the condition. Depression is now widely seen as a complex disorder with multiple contributing factors, rather than the simple chemical imbalance originally described in the 1960s.\n\nIf the causes of depression — and by extension suicide — are not solely in a person’s brain chemistry, what else could contribute? In short, depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. Many of the causes are well known—childhood trauma, family history and recreational drug use being among them. It is important to understand that suicide rarely results from one cause. Many factors—which interact with each other in complex ways—contribute to suicidal behavior. As you will see, understanding the causes of suicide can help predict and prevent its occurrence.\n","styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"narrow","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-12","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"left"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"left"},"text":{"textAlign":"left"}}}],"title":"The Causes of Suicide","markdown_content":null},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/what-are-the-causes-and-symptoms-of-depression.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"D:/laragon/www/gvd-master/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/what-are-the-causes-and-symptoms-of-depression.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/what-are-the-causes-and-symptoms-of-depression.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/what-are-the-causes-and-symptoms-of-depression","pageCssClasses":["page-blog","page-blog-what-are-the-causes-and-symptoms-of-depression"]},"layout":"PostLayout","metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"If you're struggling with depression, know that you're not alone.

It is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness. Depression can also lead to physical symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, and loss of appetite.\n\nThere are many potential causes of depression, including genetic predisposition, brain chemistry, and life events. Depression is often triggered by a stressful event, such as the death of a loved one, financial problems, or relationship difficulties. It can also be caused by medical conditions such as chronic pain or an imbalance of hormones.\n\n![](/images/man-on-the-pier-young-man-stands-on-a-wooden-pier-2022-11-02-16-32-25-utc-min.jpg)\n\n## Causes of Depression\n\nDepression is treatable with medication, therapy, and self-care. If you are struggling with depression, please know that you are not alone and there is help available. In this article, we will discuss the five main causes of depression.\n\n1.  Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.\n\n2.  Depression can be caused by a traumatic event or experience.\n\n3.  Depression can be caused by genetic factors.\n\n4.  Depression can be caused by chronic stress or anxiety.\n\n5.  Depression can be caused by certain medical conditions.\n\n*Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.*\n\nThe most common theory about the cause of depression is that it is due to a chemical imbalance in the brain. This theory suggests that people who are depressed have abnormal levels of certain chemicals, such as serotonin and norepinephrine. These chemicals are involved in regulating mood, and an imbalance can lead to feelings of sadness and despair. There is some evidence to support this theory, but it is still not fully understood how or why these imbalances occur.\n\n*Depression can be caused by a traumatic event or experience.*\n\nAnother theory about the cause of depression is that it can be triggered by a traumatic event or experience. This could be something like the death of a loved one, a divorce, or losing a job. People who have experienced trauma may be more likely to develop depression, especially if they do not have a strong support system to help them cope.\n\n*Depression can be caused by genetic factors.*\n\nDepression can also run in families, which suggests that there may be a genetic component to the condition. Studies of twins have shown that people with a family history of depression are more likely to develop the condition themselves. This does not mean that depression is inevitable if you have a family member who is affected, but it does increase your risk.\n\n*Depression can be caused by chronic stress or anxiety.*\n\nChronic stress and anxiety can also lead to depression. Stressful life events, such as financial problems or relationship difficulties, can trigger an episode of depression. Once someone is depressed, they may become more sensitive to stress and find it harder to cope, which can make the condition worse.\n\n*Depression can be caused by certain medical conditions.*\n\nThere are also some medical conditions that can cause or contribute to depression. These include thyroid problems, anemia, and vitamin deficiencies. Depression is also common in people who have chronic pain or other physical illnesses.\n\n## How is depression treated?\n\nThere are many ways that people with depression can get help. Some people need medication to feel better, but many people with depression can get better without medication. Some people need to see a therapist or counselor, and some people just need to make some changes in their life, like getting more exercise or spending time with friends. Typically, depression is treated by combining multiple approaches and is often most effective when treated in partnership with the patient. \n\n\\-Antidepressants\\\n\\-Counseling or therapy\\\n\\-Exercise\\\n\\-Dietary changes\\\n\\-Meditation\n\n*Antidepressants*\n\nThe goal of antidepressant medication is to restore the chemical balance of neurotransmitters in your brain. Although antidepressants are designed to treat depression, they are often prescribed for anxiety as well.\n\n*Counseling or therapy*\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy that can be effective in treating anxiety disorders. CBT focuses on identifying, understanding, and changing thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety.\n\n*Exercise*\n\nRegular exercise can help reduce the symptoms of anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are hormones that boost mood. Exercise can also help to reduce stress and improve sleep.\n\n*Dietary changes*\n\nEating a healthy diet and avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and sugar can help to reduce the symptoms of anxiety. Eating a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can also help to improve mood and reduce stress.\n\n*Meditation*\n\nMeditation is a relaxation technique that can help to calm the mind and body. Meditation can be done for a few minutes at a time, and there are many different ways to meditate.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are many different theories about the cause of depression, but the truth is that it is probably a combination of factors. Some people may be more vulnerable to developing depression due to genetic factors, while others may experience it after a traumatic event. Chronic stress and anxiety can also contribute to the condition. Whatever the cause, it is important to remember that depression is a real illness that can be treated.\n\nMood disorders like depression are characterized by feelings of hopelessness and a loss of enjoyment. They can be treated using a mixture of pharmcalogical, behavioural, and social interventions. Treatment for mood disorders will typically adopt a combination of interventions and are based on the needs of the individual.\n\nIf you are feeling depressed, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional for help.
